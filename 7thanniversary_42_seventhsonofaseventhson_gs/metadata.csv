42_vazov_004|the famous Baron Gulamal, the Prophet and the Seer.
42_vazov_005|ensconced within an easy chair was feeling rather queer.
42_vazov_006|and ever and on he quaffed a glass of lager beer.
42_vazov_007|He would take him for an aged man, his head was white with snows.
42_vazov_008|A false-core winter's one would think, did I not hear disclose The secret that he wore a wig and chalked his jolly nose.
42_vazov_009|While all the musky books and charts the tapers dimly shine, A globe celestial and a skull are marshalled into line.
42_vazov_010|by shapes that bear no semblance to things human or divine.
42_vazov_011|You see a picture on the wall, Saint George who slew the dragon.
42_vazov_012|He looks as if he swallowed down the contents of his flagon before he did the mighty deed. The Britons love Tobraggon.
42_vazov_013|A flaming card in public prints proclaims his wondrous skill.
42_vazov_014|For by the stars he reads your fate, your fortune, good or ill.
42_vazov_015|and what will surely come to pass.
42_vazov_016|when water runs uphill.
42_vazov_017|This seventh son of a seventh son, whose fame is known abroad, whose mystic skill is highly praised by noble Duke and Lord,
42_vazov_018|forgot when leaving foreign parts to pay his monthly board.
42_vazov_019|Of course, it was occasioned by his haste to reach the ship.
42_vazov_020|How strange such slips of memory are.
42_vazov_021|If in this case you'll dip
42_vazov_022|you'll find he kept his memory and gave his friends the slip.
42_vazov_023|As he was sitting all alone and chuckling all his games,
42_vazov_024|That craving for the marvellous which haunts poor feeble brains had brought another visitor into his strange domains.
42_vazov_025|Lo, she who stood before him now, among all maids was classed
42_vazov_026|As if to test his wondrous power, she questioned of the past.
42_vazov_027|And towards the Baron's piercing eyes A timid glance she cast.
42_vazov_028|You're married, so the stars proclaim. What's this that I decry?
42_vazov_029|Four children have your union blessed.
42_vazov_030|The Maiden gave a sign.
42_vazov_031|Then springing to her feet she shrieked
42_vazov_032|You cruel monster. Fie.
42_vazov_033|A well-dressed chap next ventured in and told him his desire.
42_vazov_034|You'll make some noise in the world, my friend, or every star's a liar.
42_vazov_035|The Baron's words were verified for he became Town Crier.
42_vazov_036|A body snatcher came to see if what Fulk said was true.
42_vazov_037|Then says the bound carelessly,
42_vazov_038|grave subjects you pursue.
42_vazov_039|Afraid to have his thoughts laid bare, the man in haste withdrew.
42_vazov_040|Next, one whose curiosity had reached the highest pitch.
42_vazov_041|desired to see his future wife and learn if she were rich.
42_vazov_042|and if her face were beautiful.
42_vazov_043|or ugly as a witch.
42_vazov_044|The Baron waved his hand and lo, a panel moved aside.
42_vazov_045|And dimly through a veil of gauze a visage he decried.
42_vazov_046|He started back his perilous death, intensely horrified.
42_vazov_047|A fearful oath he would have sworn, but he could only groan.
42_vazov_048|To steal a march on destiny he vowed he'd live alone.
42_vazov_049|He never spoke to woman more. The secret was his own.
42_vazov_050|Day after day the people came to have their fortunes told.
42_vazov_051|The rich and poor, the young and fair, the wrinkled and the old.
42_vazov_052|while Gulamal in one short year 10,000 noodles sold.
42_vazov_053|Had I the gift of Gulamal, fate's mysteries to explore.
42_vazov_054|In all the lotteries I'd invest, the highest prizes draw.
42_vazov_055|The hidden wealth of Captain Kidd should see the light once more.
