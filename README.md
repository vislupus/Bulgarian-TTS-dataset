# Georgi Speech Dataset
LibriVox dataset for Bulgarian language TTS

Georgi Speech Dataset is a public domain Bulgarian and English speech dataset. It contains 790 short audio clips on Bulgarian and 485 short audio clips on English. All of them are read by a single speaker: 9 poems on Bulgarian and 2 short stories on English. The format of the metadata is similar to that of LJ Speech so that the dataset is compatible with modern speech synthesis systems.

The texts are from [Chitanka](https://chitanka.info/book/3-epopeja-na-zabravenite), and they are in the public domain. The audio clips are from [LibriVox project](https://librivox.org/), and they are also in the public domain. The text is read by [Georgi Stoychev](https://librivox.org/reader/6803?primary_key=6803&search_category=reader&search_page=1&search_form=get_results).

The audio clips were split and transcribed with [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) and [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper).
